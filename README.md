# 42-Push-swap
## Overview
The **push_swap** project at **42 School** is a **sorting algorithm** that requires developing a program to sort a stack of integers using a predefined set of operations. The goal is to sort the stack with the fewest possible moves. This project emphasizes algorithmic thinking, efficiency, and optimization, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of data structures such as stacks.
